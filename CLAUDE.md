# CanvasTerm — Claude Code Context

## What this is

macOS desktop app: an infinite 2D spatial canvas where real PTY-backed terminal windows can be freely panned, zoomed, dragged, and resized. Built in Swift + AppKit + SwiftTerm. No web/JS runtime.

## Build

```bash
# Generate Xcode project (required after editing project.yml)
xcodegen generate

# Build from command line
xcodebuild build -scheme Mosaic -destination 'platform=macOS' -IDEPackageSupportDisableManifestSandbox=1

# Run tests
xcodebuild test -scheme MosaicTests -destination 'platform=macOS' -IDEPackageSupportDisableManifestSandbox=1

# Open in Xcode, then Cmd+B or Cmd+R
open Mosaic.xcodeproj
```

> **Note:** `-IDEPackageSupportDisableManifestSandbox=1` is required when running xcodebuild from a shell where `sandbox-exec` is blocked at the kernel level (e.g. inside Claude Code / ziplock).
>
> **ziplock one-time setup:** If running Claude Code under [ziplock](https://github.com/thejefflarson/ziplock), run this once on the host to suppress Xcode's own Package.swift manifest sandbox:
> ```bash
> defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEPackageSupportDisableManifestSandbox -bool YES
> ```
> ziplock sets `XBS_DISABLE_SANDBOXED_BUILDS=1` and `SWIFTPM_SANDBOX=0` automatically. The release script already passes `-IDEPackageSupportDisableManifestSandbox=1` to both xcodebuild invocations.

## Key architecture decisions

**Pan/zoom:** `CanvasView` holds a `FlippedView` (world space). Pan/zoom is applied as a `CGAffineTransform` on `worldView.layer`. All terminal windows are subviews positioned in world coordinates. No per-frame CPU work — CoreAnimation composites via Metal.

**Zoom-to-cursor math** is in `CanvasGeometry.swift` (`Viewport.zoomAround`). The invariant: world point under the cursor stays fixed.

**Viewport culling:** `CanvasView.updateCulling()` hides (`isHidden = true`) any terminal whose world-space frame doesn't intersect the visible rect. PTY process stays alive; only rendering is skipped.

**SwiftTerm integration:** `LocalProcessTerminalView` handles PTY spawn, I/O, and SIGWINCH. Do not override `terminalDelegate` externally — `LocalProcessTerminalView` sets it internally to pipe keystrokes to the PTY. Broadcast interception uses `InterceptingTerminalView` (subclass), which calls `super.send()` first.

**Concurrency:** Swift 6, `targeted` strict concurrency. All AppKit/UI work is `@MainActor`. `LocalProcessTerminalViewDelegate` methods are `nonisolated` and dispatch to main via `Task { @MainActor in }`. `WorkspaceStore` is `Sendable`; snapshots are value types passed to a serial `DispatchQueue`.

**Drag in world space:** Screen-space delta from `mouseDragged` must be divided by `currentZoom` before applying to world-space frame origin. Forgetting this makes windows "run away" at non-100% zoom.

**FlippedView:** `worldView` is a `FlippedView` (isFlipped = true) so Y increases downward, matching screen coordinate conventions for pan math.

**Snap engine:** `SnapEngine.swift` is a pure function (`snapRect`) that tests all 9 edge combinations (minX, midX, maxX × minY, midY, maxY) against reference rects and returns the best snap plus world-space guide line positions. `CanvasViewController.snapPosition()` calls it, converting guide positions to screen space for `SnapGuideOverlay`. During group drag, the bounding box of all selected items is snapped (not the dragged item's frame alone), and the resulting correction delta is applied uniformly to all peers.

**Controller pattern:** `TerminalController` and `AnnotationController` own their respective element sets and are created by `CanvasViewController`. Dependencies (snap, undo, theme) are injected as closures at init time so controllers never hold a back-reference to the VC. Mutations fire an `onChange` closure; the VC wires this to minimap refresh, selection ring update, and the 5-second save debounce.

**Undo model:** Undo actions are registered directly on `NSUndoManager` (via the responder chain) without grouping — each mutation is a single undoable step. Group-drag peer undos are registered in the same `mouseUp` event as the dragged item, so NSUndoManager's event-based coalescing bundles them into one Cmd+Z action automatically.

## Dependency

SwiftTerm via SPM: `https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm.git` (branch: main). Managed through xcodegen `project.yml`, not Package.swift (Package.swift exists only as a fallback compile check).

## Workspace persistence

Saves to `~/Library/Application Support/Mosaic/workspace.json` on a 5-second debounce after any change. Restores layout and working directories on launch. Terminal session content is not persisted (PTYs are always fresh).

**Shell intentionally not persisted:** on restore, Mosaic always reads `$SHELL` from the environment rather than replaying the shell recorded in the snapshot. This respects the user — if they ran `chsh` during a session, the next launch should honour that choice, not silently revert to the old shell. Do not "fix" this by persisting the shell path.

## Before pushing

Always run tests before pushing to avoid breaking CI:

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme MosaicTests -destination 'platform=macOS' -IDEPackageSupportDisableManifestSandbox=1
```

## Release

```bash
./Scripts/release.sh v0.5.3
```

The script bumps `CFBundleShortVersionString` in `Info.plist`, commits it, then builds a signed + notarized DMG, pushes the git tag, and creates a GitHub release. The working tree must be clean before running (the plist commit is made by the script itself).
Apple Developer team ID `2PR729W8E3` is hardcoded as the default. Notarytool credentials
must be stored in the login keychain under the profile name `MosaicNotarization`:

```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "MosaicNotarization" \
  --apple-id "you@example.com" \
  --team-id "2PR729W8E3" \
  --password "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"   # app-specific password from appleid.apple.com
```

## Design decisions and ADRs

ADRs live under `Docs/ADR/`. When a design choice is deliberate but **looks
wrong to a naive reviewer** — usually because it goes against a generic
"defense-in-depth" recommendation that an automated scanner or PR bot would
flag — write it up as a numbered ADR and link the inline comment at the call
site to that ADR.

Triggers to write a new ADR (not exhaustive):

- You're reverting a change that re-tightens a security control you previously
  loosened on purpose (allowlist↔denylist flips, containment add/remove,
  scheme handling, sanitiser strictness).
- A reviewer (human or bot) would reasonably ask "why isn't this stricter?"
  and the answer is "we picked the less strict option deliberately, and here's
  the threat-model argument."
- A workaround for a third-party library annotation that you've documented
  inline in one place but is likely to come up in code review repeatedly.

Link the ADR from the inline comment so the next reviewer (or scanner) follows
the trail. `SECURITY.md`'s Threat Model section is a good index for
security-relevant ADRs.

## Known workarounds to revisit

**Xcode 26.4 test runner hang (added 2026-03-31):** `xcodebuild test` hangs for ~340 seconds with "The test runner hung before establishing connection" on Xcode 26.4 / macOS 26.4 regardless of test code. This is an Xcode 26.4 regression — CI uses Xcode 26.2 where tests run fine. Do not spend time debugging this locally; just push and let CI validate.

**Kitty keyboard arrow key fix (added 2026-03-25, revisit ~2026-04-08):** Claude Code v2.1.83
introduced a regression ("Fixed mouse tracking escape sequences leaking to shell prompt after exit")
that causes kitty keyboard mode to be pushed to all terminals, not just kitty-capable ones. SwiftTerm
honours the push and incorrectly encodes macOS cursor arrow keys as keypad arrows (CSI 57419u/57420u)
because macOS always sets the `.numericPad` flag on cursor arrow events. Workaround: a local
`NSEvent` monitor in `TerminalWindowView.setupTerminal()` strips `.numericPad` from the CGEvent
before SwiftTerm sees it. Once Claude Code fixes the regression, remove the monitor and its `deinit`
cleanup (`kittyArrowMonitor`).

## Planned features (not yet implemented)

- Minimap click/drag accuracy improvements
- Resize handle cursors (currently crosshair for all corner/edge handles)
